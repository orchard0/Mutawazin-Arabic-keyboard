# لوحة مفاتيح متوازنة – Mutawazin (balanced) keyboard: speedy, efficient and comfortable.

Inspired by the design principles of OJ Bucao’s Workman keyboard I redesigned the Arabic keyboard with comfort, efficiency and speed in mind.

![Mutawazin Keyboard Layout](https://github.com/orchid6/Mutawazin-Arabic-keyboard/blob/master/Mutawazin%20Arabic%20Keyboard.png) 

Advantages: 
* 60% of the load is on the eight home keys! This means less finger moment compared to PC  (33%) and MAC (33%).
* 80% of the load is now on the easiest to type keys. MAC (47%) and PC (43%)
* Comfortable and efficient — frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers.
* Reduced lateral movement of the fingers and wrists.
* Very, very low overall finger travel.
* 50/50 balanced left and right hand load
* Lowest load on «Shift Key» use to type letters (6.5%). PC (7.2%); MAC (7.0%).
* Lowest load in the harder to reach middle column and end area of the keyboard (4%). PC (34%); MAC (32%).
* Lowest load on the right pinky (6%). MAC (8%) and PC (10%).
* For the top 300 bigrams (letters that occur together like ا and ل) Mutawazin has the lowest percentage typed on the same finger (2.9%) and the lowest lowest percentage typed by the same hand (10.9%). MAC (3.6% and 11.3%) and PC (3.0% and 11.7%). 
* Familiar location for punctuation keys.
* Features all eight diacritics (Tashkil) marks on one hand placed in order of frequency.

# Data analysis:

Character and bigram frequencies were calculated using over 25,000 pages from over 150 books (including the Quran).

Total biagrams: 15,328,257
Total letters analysed = 20,243,768
Total characters removed from analysis (these include numerals, punctuation, space, Latin letters and so forth): 6,203,330

| 32 | ء | 0.47% |
| 33 | ظ | 0.28% |
| 34 | ئ | 0.26% |
| 35 | آ | 0.22% |
| 36 | ؤ | 0.12% |

There are only 28 letters in the Arabic alphabet but some letters like ء take up to 5 different ligature forms depending on their position in the word; some ligatures of ء like أ occur 530% more often than the pure form. This is a very important consideration. The letter ء including all it&#39;s ligatures has a combined frequency of 4.05%. (That would be below the ت in position 10 in the table above.) Putting all these ligatures in one key would require the too much use of the «Shift Key» as well as the use of the «Alt-Gr Key» and «Shift Key» + «Alt-Gr Key» combo and it would still leave one ligature left. Use of the shift keys needs to be minimised for both comfort and speed. Plus common ligatures need to be given their own keys.

## The keyboard zones:

_OJ Bucao_ correctly observed in his design of the English Workman keyboard that some fingers like the index and middle finger are much stronger than the pinky finger. Therefore more load should be placed on these fingers. Furthermore it is easier for longer fingers like the middle and ring fingers to stretch and easier for shorter fingers like the index and pinky fingers to fold.

Moreover vertical movement is natural to the fingers, whereas horizontal and diagonal stretching is uncomfortable. Hence the most occurring letters/ligatures need to be on keys that are the easiest to press; this will increase comfort, efficiency (finger travel) and therefore speed. Based on these observations the keyboard can be divided into 5 zones of comfort. (See the picture below.):

![Keyboard comfort zones](https://github.com/orchid6/Mutawazin-Arabic-keyboard/blob/master/Keyboard%20zones%20of%20comfort.png)
<img src="https://github.com/orchid6/Mutawazin-Arabic-keyboard/blob/master/Keyboard%20zones%20of%20comfort%20legend.png" alt="Legend" width="200"/>

1. The Core Zone is the easiest to type and mainly consists of the home keys plus stretching for the middle and ring fingers and folding for the index finger.
2. The Inner Zone is a level slightly harder than the previous one: This zone includes two keys for each index finger that requires only a slight diagonal fold for the bottom key and a slight vertical stretch for the top key.
3. The Outer Zone is slightly less uncomfortable then the previous zone. Here the long middle and ring fingers need to fold which is harder for them then stretching and the short pinky finger does both stretching and folding. (Although it is easier for the short pinky finger to fold these bottom keys are included in this zone because the pinky is overall the weakest finger on the hand and so the load on it needs to be minimised.)
4. Right in the centre is the Middle Column, this is a challenging place even for the strong index finger to reach because a high degree of uncomfortable horizontal and vertical stretching is required. Hence the use of these keys need to be minimised as much as possible.
5. Finally the End Zone includes the rest of the keys. It&#39;s the most challenging zone on the keyboard because firstly the weak pinky needs to be used and secondly it is required to significantly stretch horizontally and vertically. This should be a place of last resort as the whole wrist and hand may need to be moved to reach these keys. Therefore this zone is most suitable for rarely used but still necessary punctuation marks.

Based on these observations and principles and the letter frequencies given above the following keyboard has been designed:

![Mutawazin Arabic Keyboard](https://github.com/orchid6/Mutawazin-Arabic-keyboard/blob/master/Mutawazin%20Arabic%20Keyboard.png)

The colour&#39;s represent the different keys for each finger. Note how each finger is curving slightly outward.

Let&#39;s do some statistical analysis and compare Mutawazin to the Apple&#39;s Arabic keyboard and the IBM/PC&#39;s Arabic keyboard, the standard keyboards on laptops and desktops worldwide.

## The home keys and keyboard zones:

On the eight home keys, the natural resting place of the fingers, Mutawazin boasts a 60% load compared to 33% for Apple and IBM. That&#39;s equivalent to pressing 600 in every 1000 keys on Mutawazin compared to only 330 on Apple and IBM. This means that your fingers don&#39;t move as much which is more efficient, comfortable and faster.

The core zone includes the home keys and the next six easiest to type keys. The more time fingers spend here the more comfortable and efficient they will be. On Mutawazin the core zone has a load of 800 out of every 1000 keystrokes compared to only 470 on the Apple and 430 on the IBM. This means you will type 172% more in this zone compared to Apple and 186% more compared to IBM. That&#39;s a lot of saved finger and wrist movement!

Now including the next easiest zone, the inner zone, with Mutawazin you will type 850 out of every 1000 keystrokes and in Apple 580 and on IBM 560.

Significantly, 1 in 10,000 keystrokes will be in the end zone, the most difficult zone, and only for punctuation marks not letters unlike IBM and Apple. On IBM it&#39;s 600 in 10,000 keystrokes in this zone and on Apple 390 in 10,000 keystrokes.

The keyboard has been designed to reduce load as you move your finger&#39;s out of the core zone. (Could say more on this).

## Finger and hand loads and balance:

The load decreases to zero moving out from the core zone, whereas in Apple&#39;s and IBM&#39;s it increases again significantly for the middle column from 6% in the outer zone to 28% in the middle column for Apple and 9% to 28% for IBM.

For maximum efficiency in typing the weight should be distributed between each type of finger whilst taking into account the relative strength of each finger. Give too much work to the index finger misses out on work that could be done on other fingers. See how the finger compar in Mutawazin: 45% (index) → 25% (middle) → 19% (ring)→ 11% (pinky).

Apple: 57% (index) → 21% (middle) → 12% (ring)→ 10% (pinky).

IBM: 51% (index) → 25% (middle) → 12% (ring)→ 13% (pinky). The pinky has more work then the middle!

Looking at the weight profiles for each finger it&#39;s clear that the index fingers in both Apple and IBM do more work (57% and 51% respectively) compared to Mutawazin&#39;s 45%. This may seem a good thing however reaching for the difficult middle column is not easy for the index finger. It involves difficult horizontal and diagonal stretching. In both Apple and IBM the middle column load is 28% compared to only 4% in Mutawazin!

The weakest fingers are the pinkies so the load on them needs to be minimised. Mutawazin&#39;s total pinky load is 11%, Apple&#39;s is 10% and IBM&#39;s 12%. Although Apple&#39;s is lower then Mutawazin, it&#39;s only 10 less keys in every 1000 keystrokes. More importantly however is the balance between the right and left pinky. On Apple&#39;s keyboard the right pinky has to do more work than the left pinky, which is not great for the right pinky. For every 16 keystrokes on the left pinky the right has 82 keystrokes. On Mutawazin for every 56 keystrokes on the left pinky the right has 58. This is excellent balance between the pinkies, the weakest fingers, and so less tiredness of one pinky.

The other fingers are also a like the are all balanced between left and right with the biggest difference in load being only 1%.

The balance between each hand is 50% on Mutawazin! Compare this with Apple&#39;s left hand load of 38% and right hand load of 62% and IBM&#39;s left hand load of 39% and right hand load of 61%. The right hand in both have more load.

## Letters via «Shift Key».

On Apple 7.0% of load is on letters accessed via the «Shift Key». On IBM it&#39;s 7.2% and on Mutawazin it&#39;s 6.5%. This means that you will on average need to press the shift key only 65 times in every 1000 keystrokes saving 7 presses on the IBM and 5 presses on Apple. So although at first it may appear that too many important letters can only be accessed by the «Shift Key» the data clearly shows that it&#39;s just an illusion and it&#39;s an improvement over IBM and Apple. Only the least frequent letters are accessed by the «Shift Key».

## Bigrams:

The top 20 bigrams are listed below. There are a total of 1296 bigrams in Arabic (36^2). (All can be found in the statistical table.)

| Frequency | Bigram |
| --- | --- |
| (&#39;ا&#39;, &#39;ل&#39;) | 6.2% |
| (&#39;ا&#39;, &#39;ن&#39;) | 1.3% |
| (&#39;ل&#39;, &#39;م&#39;) | 1.3% |
| (&#39;ه&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 1.2% |
| (&#39;ل&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 1.2% |
| (&#39;م&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 1.1% |
| (&#39;و&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 1.0% |
| (&#39;ي&#39;, &#39;ن&#39;) | 0.9% |
| (&#39;ل&#39;, &#39;ي&#39;) | 0.9% |
| (&#39;م&#39;, &#39;ن&#39;) | 0.9% |
| (&#39;ن&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 0.9% |
| (&#39;ع&#39;, &#39;ل&#39;) | 0.8% |
| (&#39;و&#39;, &#39;ل&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;أ&#39;, &#39;ن&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ف&#39;, &#39;ي&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ل&#39;, &#39;ى&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ل&#39;, &#39;ك&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ا&#39;, &#39;ت&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ا&#39;, &#39;ر&#39;) | 0.7% |
| (&#39;ي&#39;, &#39;ا&#39;) | 0.6% |

The top 300 most frequent bigrams make up 82.3% of all bigrams analysed. I will use this to compare the keyboard designs.

Firstly typing two letters using the same finger is slower then alternating fingers, this is also the case with the hands. It&#39;s faster to type with alternating between hands.

In Mutawazin only 29 in every 1000 bigrams typed will be done by the same finger. This is 36 and 30 for Apple and IBM respectively. Which means it&#39;s slightly easier on Mutawazin then Apple and a little more easier compared to IBM.

109 in every 1000 bigrams typed will be by the same hand in Mutawazin, compared to 113 in Apple and 117 in IBM. So your hands will alternate more typing which is better for comfort and efficiency. Moreover the balance between the bigrams that will need to be typed by the same hand there is better in Mutawazin: for every 122 bigrams typed on the left hand the right hand will do only 100. Where as in IBM it is 40:100 and in Apple 49:100.

What about bigrams what require the use of the shift key? Only 4 in every 1000 bigrams will be typed by the same finger and will require a «Shift Key» press either before or after. In IBM it&#39;s 1 in every 1000 and in Apple 8 in every 1000. Although IBM has less letters under the shift key in order to reach for certain letters like ذ, د , ج and ط it would be easier to just press the «Shift Key» instead of shifting the hand a significant distance to reach these letters.

Give the preceding analysis it is clear that Mutawazin is a more comfortable, efficient and faster to use keyboard compared to the Apple&#39;s and IBM&#39;s.
