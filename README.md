# The Arabic keyboard needed a redesign 

There are in effect two Arabic Keyboards: the PC/IBM design and the Apple's Mac design. In the spirit of creating a keyboard that's easier on fingers let me introduce: Arabe.

Advantages: 
* Highest percentage of the most common letters on the home row means less overall finger moment compared to PC and MAC versions.
* Lowest percentage of the most common letters on the bottom row means less overall finger moment to reach the more challenging bottom row compared to PC and MAC versions.
* Familiar location for punctuation keys
* Comfortable, ergonomic, and efficient — frequent keys are placed within the natural range of motion of the fingers
* Reduced lateral movement of the fingers and wrists
* Very, very low overall finger travel
* Reduced load on the right pinky compared to PC and MAC versions
* More balanced left and right hand usage compared to PC and MAC versions
* High same hand utilization and plenty of easy combos
* Commost commmon Arabic bigrams are easy to type and located on sperate hands for faster typing
* Soon Available for Windows, Mac OS. Currently available for Linux. (Please contribute to developing solutions for Windows and Mac as I don't know yet.)

## Analysis:

**Finger and Hand Percentages**

ا and ل are the most frequently occuring letters (accounting for around 24% of all letters) and therefore it makes sense to have them on the 'bump' keys (the natural resting place of the strong index fingers). This is easier then streching the index fingers horizontally.
